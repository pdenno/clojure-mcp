Starts an interactive code review conversation that provides constructive feedback on your Clojure code.

HOW TO USE THIS TOOL:
1. Submit your Clojure code for initial critique
2. Review the suggestions and implement improvements
3. Test your revised code in the REPL
4. Submit the updated code for additional feedback
5. Continue this cycle until the critique is satisfied

This tool initiates a feedback loop where you:
- Receive detailed analysis of your code
- Implement suggested improvements
- Test and verify changes
- Get follow-up critique on your revisions

The critique examines:
- Adherence to Clojure style conventions
- Functional programming best practices
- Performance optimizations
- Readability and maintainability improvements
- Idiomatic Clojure patterns

Example conversation flow:
- You: Submit initial function implementation
- Tool: Provides feedback on style and structure
- You: Revise code based on suggestions and test in REPL
- Tool: Reviews updates and suggests further refinements
- Repeat until code quality goals are achieved

Perfect for iterative learning and continuous code improvement.
