  "Fallback implementation that uses Java to search file contents.
   This implementation recursively traverses the directory structure,

   Features:
   - Pure Java implementation that works without external commands
   - Supports file filtering with glob-like patterns
   - Stops searching a file as soon as a match is found to improve performance
   - Sorts results by file modification time
   - Handles errors gracefully by skipping problematic files
   
   Arguments:
   - path: Directory to search in
   - pattern: Regular expression pattern to search for
   - include: Optional file pattern to include (e.g. \"*.clj\", \"*.{clj,cljs}\")
   - max-results: Maximum number of results to return
   
   Returns a map with:
   - :filenames - Vector of matching file paths sorted by modification time

   - :durationMs - Time taken for the search in milliseconds
