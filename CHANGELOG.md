# Changelog

## [0.1.8-alpha] - 2025-08-13

### What's New

This release brings major configuration enhancements and improved
Clojure code editing.

In terms of Clojure editing, these improvements are significant. There
used to be some edit thrashing when editing functions with comments
that directly preceed them. This is now fixed. When the LLM wants to
replace a function along with its preceeding comments, clojure-mcp does
the right thing.

The sexp replacement has been revamped yet again. Sexpr replacement
will now succeed most of the time while being preceeding comment aware
as well.

The other big step forward is the addition of custom model
configuration in the `config.edn`. This is a direct result of
`langchain4j` improving its model support. Now you can define custom
model configurations to be used by the agent tools.

Other `.clojure-mcp/config.edn` configuration improvements allow you to 
* `:enable-tools` `:disable-tools`
* `:enable-prompts` `:disable-prompts`
* `:enable-resources` `:disable-resources`
* add tool specific configuration in `:tools-config`

With all these changes, I'm going to be removing the `-alpha` from the next release tag.

** Key Highlights:**
- **Custom LLM Models** - Define your own model configurations in `.clojure-mcp/config.edn` with environment variable support for API keys
- **Scittle Support** - Connect directly to Scittle nREPL without configuration - fun stuff!
- **Component Filtering** - Choose exactly which tools, prompts, and resources your server exposes
- **Improved Code Editing** - Much better handling of preceeding comments and sexp editing
- **Tool Configuration** - Configure individual tools with custom settings including model selection

**Example Model Configuration:**
```edn
:models {;; use the OpenAI client to connect to other models
         :openai/glm {:model-name "z-ai/glm-4.5"
                      :api-key [:env "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"]
                      :base-url [:env "OPENROUTER_BASE_URL"]
                      :temperature 1}
         :anthropic/my-claude {:model-name "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
                               :temperature 0.7}}

:tools-config {:dispatch_agent {:model :openai/my-fast}}
```

Currently these defined models are mainly used for the built-in agents, but if clojure-mcp had a cli that you could send prompts to...

## [0.1.7-alpha] - 2025-07-22

Note the major changes listed in `0.1.7-alpha-pre` below which are part of this release.

Moving out of pre-release with several code fixes. A new configuration option allows the dispatch_agent to load files as context. The `:dispatch-agent-context` setting accepts either:
- `true` - automatically loads `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (if available) and `./.clojure-mcp/code_index.txt` (the new default output location for `clojure-mcp.code-indexer`)
- A vector of file paths - loads the specified files into the dispatch_agent context

This enables dispatch_agent to have better project awareness through pre-loaded context files.

### Fixed
- **Race condition in nREPL session creation** - Fixed critical race condition in `clojure-mcp.nrepl/new-session` that could cause session initialization failures
- **Working directory handling** - Shell commands now properly use the working directory when executing

### Added
- **:mcp-client-hint configuration** - New config option for providing hints to MCP clients about tool capabilities, used in scratch_pad tool schema - currently this allows me to experiment with using the more specific scratch_pad schema on claude desktop...
- **:dispatch-agent-context configuration** - New config option for providing context to dispatch agents 

### Changed
- **Updated to latest Clojure version** - Project now uses the most recent Clojure release
- **Code simplification** - Various internal simplifications to improve maintainability

### Documentation
- **Dual Shadow mode documentation** - Added documentation for dual Shadow CLJS mode setup
- **Minor grammar fixes** - Improved clarity in various documentation sections
- **Updated PROJECT_SUMMARY prompt** - Corrected command name in documentation

### Internal
- Fixed nREPL server function invocation
- Moved default code indexer output in preparation for dispatch-agent-content configuration
- Minor deps.edn configuration adjustments

### Contributors
Thanks to Jonathon McKitrick for documenting dual Shadow mode and Thomas Mattacchione for the PROJECT_SUMMARY prompt update.

## [v0.1.7-alpha-pre] - 2025-07-08

### Major Improvements

#### Performance Fix: Startup Speed
Fixed critical issue where ClojureMCP was scanning the home directory, causing extremely slow startup times. The fix includes:
- **Project inspection optimization**: Reduced from multiple glob calls to a single optimized call
- **Path validation**: Fixed bad paths being passed to glob functions that caused excessive filesystem scanning

#### Multi-Dialect Support
Initial support for non-JVM Clojure dialects including Babashka and Basilisp:
- **Reduced Initializing Clojure Evals**: Minimized reliance on Clojure code evaluation on startup
- **Multimethod dispatch**: Added `:nrepl-env-type` based dispatch for dialect-specific behavior
- **Configuration**: Use `:project-dir` command-line option to specify working directory for alternative dialects
- **Note**: Disable `:bash-over-nrepl` in `.clojure-mcp/config.edn` for non-JVM environments

#### Scratch Pad Persistence 
The scratch pad now automatically saves to `.clojure-mcp/scratch_pad.edn` on every change:
- **Explicit loading**: Use `scratch_pad_load` prompt to load saved data
- **Snapshot saving**: Use `scratch_pad_save_as` prompt to save snapshots to named files
- **Configurable filename**: Set `:scratch-pad-file` in config to use different filenames
- **Auto-load on startup**: Enable with `:scratch-pad-load true` in config
Many thanks to Mark Addleman for working on this.

### Added
- **Multi-dialect support infrastructure**:
  - `:nrepl-env-type` configuration parameter for dialect detection
  - Multimethod dispatch system for dialect-specific behavior
  - Support for Babashka, and Basilisp environments
- **Scratch pad persistence** with flexible configuration via `.clojure-mcp/config.edn`:
  - `:scratch-pad-load` boolean flag for auto-loading on startup (default: `false`)
  - `:scratch-pad-file` to specify filename within `.clojure-mcp/` directory (default: `"scratch_pad.edn"`)
  - Automatic saving on every change
- **New prompts for scratch pad file operations**:
  - `ACT/scratch_pad_load` prompt for loading EDN files into scratch pad
  - `ACT/scratch_pad_save_as` prompt for saving scratch pad snapshots to named files
- **Project directory override** with `:project-dir` command-line option
- **Pattern-based collapsed view for text files** in `read_file` tool:
  - Shows only lines matching patterns with 20 lines of context
  - Works with `content_pattern` or `name_pattern` parameters
- **Bash execution isolation**:
  - `:bash-over-nrepl` config option to control execution mode (default: `true`)
  - Separate nREPL session for bash commands to prevent REPL pollution
  - Output truncation for local bash execution

## [v0.1.5-alpha] - 2025-06-22

### Major Refactoring: Simplified Custom MCP Server Creation

The project has undergone a significant refactor to make creating custom MCP servers dramatically easier. The new pattern uses factory functions and a single entry point, reducing custom server creation to just a few lines of code.
