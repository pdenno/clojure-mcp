# Configuring Custom Agents

The Clojure MCP server supports defining custom AI agents through configuration. Each configured agent becomes its own tool in the MCP interface, allowing you to create specialized assistants without writing code.

## Overview

The agent tool builder dynamically creates MCP tools from agent configurations defined in your `.clojure-mcp/config.edn` file. Each agent can have:
- Its own system prompt and personality
- Access to specific tools (read, write, execute, or none)
- Custom context (files, project info)
- Different AI models
- Unique name and description

## ⚠️ Important: Tool Access Changes

**Agents have NO tools by default.** You must explicitly specify which tools an agent can use via `:enable-tools`. This is a safety feature to prevent unintended access to powerful capabilities.

Agents can now access ALL available tools, including:
- Read-only tools (grep, read-file, etc.)
- **File editing tools** (file-write, clojure-edit, etc.)
- **Code execution tools** (clojure-eval, bash)
- Agent tools (dispatch-agent, architect)

Always consider the security implications when granting tool access.

## Basic Configuration

Add an `:agents` key to your `.clojure-mcp/config.edn`:

```clojure
{:agents [{:id :my-agent
           :name "my_agent"
           :description "A custom agent for specific tasks"
           :system-message "You are a helpful assistant specialized in..."
           :context true
           :enable-tools [:read-file :grep]  ; Must explicitly list tools
           :disable-tools nil}]}
```

## Configuration Options

Each agent configuration supports the following keys:

### Required Fields

- **`:id`** - Unique keyword identifier for the agent
- **`:name`** - String name that appears as the tool name in MCP
- **`:description`** - String description shown in the MCP interface
- **`:system-message`** - System prompt that defines the agent's behavior

### Optional Fields

- **`:model`** - AI model to use (keyword reference or model object)
  - References models defined in `:models` config
  - Falls back to default if not specified
- **`:context`** - What context to provide the agent:
  - `true` - Include PROJECT_SUMMARY.md and code index
  - `false` or `nil` - No context
  - `["file1.md", "file2.clj"]` - Specific file paths
- **`:enable-tools`** - Controls which tools the agent can use:
  - `nil` - **No tools** (default if omitted)
  - `[:all]` - All available tools
  - `[:tool1 :tool2]` - Specific tools only
- **`:disable-tools`** - List of tool IDs to disable (applied after enable-tools)
- **`:memory-size`** - Controls conversation memory behavior:
  - `nil`, `false`, or `< 10` - **Stateless** (default): Clears memory on each chat
  - `>= 10` - **Persistent**: Accumulates messages up to limit, then resets completely

## Available Tools for Agents

## Tool Access Patterns

### No Tools (Default)
```clojure
{:id :minimal-agent
 :name "minimal_agent"
 :description "Agent with no tools"
 :system-message "You provide advice based only on your training"
 ;; :enable-tools nil  ; Can omit - nil is default
}
```

### Read-Only Access
```clojure
{:id :research-agent
 :name "research_agent"
 :description "Can read but not modify"
 :system-message "You research and analyze code"
 :enable-tools [:read-file :grep :glob-files :clojure-inspect-project]}
```

### Write Access
```clojure
{:id :code-writer
 :name "code_writer"
 :description "Can create and modify files"
 :system-message "You write and refactor code. Always test before writing."
 :enable-tools [:read-file :grep :clojure-eval :file-write :clojure-edit]}
```

### Full Access
```clojure
{:id :full-access-agent
 :name "full_access"
 :description "Access to all tools - use with caution"
 :system-message "You have full system access. Confirm destructive operations."
 :enable-tools [:all]
 :disable-tools [:dispatch-agent]  ; Can still exclude specific tools
}
```

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive configuration with agents of varying capability levels:

```clojure
{:allowed-directories ["." "src" "test" "resources"]
 
 ;; Define custom models (optional)

           :description "Runs tests and analyzes results"
           :system-message "You run tests and analyze results. You can execute code 
                           but cannot modify files."
           :context ["test/"]
           :memory-size 5  ; < 10 = stateless

           :disable-tools nil}]}
```

## Using Configured Agents

Once configured, your agents appear as individual tools in your MCP client (like Claude Desktop):

1. Each agent shows up with its configured name (e.g., `research_agent`, `code_writer`)
2. Select the appropriate agent tool for your task
3. Send your prompt to the agent
4. The agent responds according to its specialized configuration and tool access

### Example Usage

```
User: research_agent("Find all uses of multimethods in this project")
Research Agent: I'll search for multimethod usage across the project...
[Uses only read-only tools to search and analyze]

User: code_writer("Add a new test for the filter-tools function")
Code Writer: I'll create a test for filter-tools. Let me first examine the existing tests...
[Can read, evaluate, and write files]

User: advisor("What's the best way to structure a Clojure web app?")
Advisor: Based on common patterns and best practices...
[Provides advice without accessing any tools]
```

## Security Considerations

### Principle of Least Privilege

Always give agents the minimum tools necessary for their task:

1. **No tools** for general advice/consultation
2. **Read-only tools** for analysis and research
3. **Execution tools** only when testing is required
4. **Write tools** only when file modification is needed
5. **Full access** only in controlled environments with trusted users

### Risk Levels

| Access Level | Risk | Use Cases |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| No tools | **None** | General advice, explanations |
| Read-only | **Low** | Code review, research, analysis |
| Read + Execute | **Medium** | Testing, debugging, validation |
| Read + Write | **High** | Code generation, refactoring |
| All tools | **Very High** | System administration, complex automation |

### Best Practices

1. **Default to no tools** - Only add what's needed
2. **Use `:disable-tools`** to remove dangerous tools even from `:all`
3. **Clear system messages** - Instruct agents about responsible tool use
4. **Audit configurations** - Regularly review agent capabilities
5. **Test in sandbox** - Try new configurations in safe environments first

## Context Configuration

The `:context` field controls what information the agent has access to:

### Default Context (`:context true`)
Includes:
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` if it exists
- Current project structure from `clojure-inspect-project`
- `.clojure-mcp/code_index.txt` if it exists

### Custom File Context
```clojure
:context ["README.md"           ; Single file
          "doc/"                ; All files in directory
          "src/my_app/core.clj" ; Specific source file
          "../other-project/summary.md"] ; Relative paths work
```

### No Context (`:context false` or `:context nil`)
Agent starts with only its system message, useful for general-purpose agents.

## Model Configuration

Agents can use custom models defined in the `:models` configuration:

```clojure
{:models {:openai/o3-mini
          {:model-name "o3-mini"
           :api-key [:env "OPENAI_API_KEY"]
           :temperature 0.1}}
           
 :agents [{:id :reasoning-agent
           :name "reasoning_agent"
           :model :openai/o3-mini  ; Reference the model
           ;; ... other config
           }]}
```

## Memory Configuration

The `:memory-size` field controls how agents handle conversation memory between invocations. Unlike a sliding window that continuously drops old messages, persistent agents accumulate messages until approaching their limit, then completely reset.

### Memory Modes

| Configuration | Mode | Behavior |
|--------------|------|----------|
| `nil` (default) | **Stateless** | Clears memory before each chat, starts fresh |
| `false` | **Stateless** | Explicitly stateless, same as `nil` |
| `< 10` | **Stateless** | Numbers less than 10 treated as stateless |
| `>= 10` | **Persistent** | Accumulates messages up to limit, then resets |

### Stateless Mode (Default)

Stateless agents clear their memory at the start of each chat but maintain a 100-message buffer during the conversation:

```clojure
{:id :task-agent
 :name "task_agent"
 ;; No memory-size specified = stateless (default)
 :description "Performs independent tasks"
 :system-message "You complete tasks independently..."}

{:id :analyzer
 :name "analyzer"  
 :memory-size false  ; Explicitly stateless
 :description "Analyzes code without conversation history"
 :system-message "You analyze code..."}
```

**Benefits of Stateless:**
- Predictable behavior - each invocation starts fresh
- No context pollution from previous tasks
- Ideal for single-purpose operations
- Still supports complex multi-turn conversations (100-message buffer)

### Persistent Mode

Persistent agents maintain conversation history across invocations, accumulating messages until approaching the configured limit:

```clojure
{:id :assistant
 :name "assistant"
 :memory-size 50  ; Accumulates up to ~35 messages, then resets
 :description "Conversational assistant with memory"
 :system-message "You are a helpful assistant..."}

{:id :tutor
 :name "tutor"
 :memory-size 100  ; Accumulates up to ~85 messages, then resets
 :description "Educational tutor that remembers previous lessons"
 :system-message "You are a patient tutor..."}
```

**Persistent Memory Behavior:**
- Accumulates conversation history across multiple invocations
- When approaching memory limit (size - 15 messages), completely resets
- Re-adds original context after reset to maintain coherence
- NOT a sliding window - it's a buffer that resets when nearly full

### Special Case: Dispatch Agent

The `dispatch_agent` tool defaults to persistent mode with a 100-message window. This can be overridden in `:tools-config`:

```clojure
{:tools-config {:dispatch_agent {:memory-size 200}}  ; Increase dispatch agent memory
 ;; or
 :tools-config {:dispatch_agent {:memory-size false}}} ; Make dispatch agent stateless
```

### Memory Size Examples

```clojure
{:agents [;; Stateless examples
          {:id :code-reviewer
           :name "code_reviewer"
           ;; Default: no memory-size = stateless
           :description "Reviews code independently each time"
           :system-message "Review the provided code..."}
          
          {:id :test-runner
           :name "test_runner"
           :memory-size 5  ; < 10 = stateless
           :description "Runs tests without history"
           :system-message "Run and analyze test results..."}
          
          ;; Persistent examples
          {:id :chat-bot
           :name "chat_bot"
           :memory-size 30  ; Small buffer - resets after ~15 messages
           :description "Simple chatbot with short-term memory"
           :system-message "You are a friendly chatbot..."}
          
          {:id :project-assistant
           :name "project_assistant"
           :memory-size 100  ; Standard buffer - resets after ~85 messages
           :description "Project assistant with conversation memory"
           :system-message "You help with ongoing project tasks..."}
          
          {:id :long-context-agent
           :name "long_context"
           :memory-size 300  ; Large buffer - resets after ~285 messages
           :description "Agent for complex, long-running conversations"
           :system-message "You handle complex multi-part tasks..."}]}
```

### Choosing the Right Memory Configuration

**Use Stateless (default) when:**
- Each task is independent
- You want predictable, fresh behavior
- Handling sensitive data that shouldn't persist
- Building single-purpose tools
- Avoiding context pollution is important

**Use Persistent when:**
- Building conversational interfaces
- Tasks build on previous interactions
- Maintaining context across multiple queries
- Creating tutoring or coaching agents
- Implementing multi-step workflows

### Memory Management Details

**Stateless agents:**
- Clear memory at the start of each `chat` invocation
- Re-initialize with configured context
- Maintain 100-message buffer during the conversation
- Perfect for complex single tasks with many tool calls

**Persistent agents:**
- Keep conversation history between invocations
- Accumulate messages until approaching limit (size - 15)
- Completely reset memory when limit approached (not a sliding window)
- Re-add original context after reset
- Ensures conversations remain coherent by avoiding partial memory loss

## Tool Filtering Logic

- If `:enable-tools` is `nil` or omitted: **No tools enabled**
- If `:enable-tools` is `[:all]`: All available tools enabled
- If `:enable-tools` is `[...]`: Only listed tools enabled
- `:disable-tools` is applied after `:enable-tools` to remove specific tools

Examples:
```clojure
;; No tools (default)
{:enable-tools nil}  ; or omit entirely

;; Specific tools only
{:enable-tools [:read-file :grep]}

;; All tools except some
{:enable-tools [:all]
 :disable-tools [:bash :file-write]}
```

## Caching and Performance

- Agents are cached after first creation for performance
- The same agent instance is reused across invocations
- Cache key is based on the agent's `:id`
- Memory behavior depends on `:memory-size` configuration:
  - **Stateless agents**: Memory clears on each invocation (fresh start)
  - **Persistent agents**: Memory persists across invocations within the session
- Agent cache persists for the duration of the MCP server session

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Appearing
- Check that `:agents` is properly formatted in `config.edn`
- Ensure all required fields (`:id`, `:name`, `:description`, `:system-message`) are present
- Restart the MCP server after configuration changes

### No Tools Available
- Remember: agents have no tools by default
- Explicitly list tools in `:enable-tools`
- Check tool IDs match exactly (e.g., `:read-file` not `:read_file`)

### Model Not Found
- Verify model is defined in `:models` configuration
- Check environment variables for API keys
- Ensure model name is correct for the provider

### Tools Not Working
- Verify tool IDs in `:enable-tools` match available tools
- Check that tools aren't disabled in `:disable-tools`
- Ensure the agent has the necessary tool combination (e.g., needs `:read-file` before `:clojure-edit`)

### Memory Issues
- **Agent doesn't remember previous conversation**: Check if `:memory-size` is `>= 10` for persistent memory
- **Agent remembers unwanted context**: Set `:memory-size` to `nil`, `false`, or `< 10` for stateless behavior
- **Conversation becomes incoherent**: Memory may be too small; increase `:memory-size` for longer conversations
- **Agent resets mid-conversation**: This happens when memory approaches limit (size - 15); increase `:memory-size`
- **Important**: Persistent memory is NOT a sliding window - it accumulates messages then resets completely

## Migration from Previous Versions

If you have existing agent configurations:

### Old Behavior (pre-update)
- Agents had all read-only tools by default
- Could not access write or execution tools

### New Behavior
- Agents have NO tools by default
- Can access any tools when explicitly enabled

### Migration Steps
1. Review existing agent configs
2. Add explicit `:enable-tools` lists
3. For read-only agents, add: `:enable-tools [:read-file :grep :glob-files ...]`
4. Test thoroughly before deploying

## Integration with MCP Server

The agent tool builder is automatically included in the main MCP server. When the server starts:

1. Reads the `:agents` configuration from `.clojure-mcp/config.edn`
2. Creates a separate tool for each configured agent
3. Each agent gets only its specified tools
4. Registers these tools with the MCP protocol
5. Each agent appears as an individual tool in your MCP client

No code changes are required - just add agent configurations to your `config.edn` file and restart the server.
