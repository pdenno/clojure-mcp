# Generate Your Custom MCP Server with AI

Welcome to the new age of MCP server configuration! You can now use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a fully customized Clojure MCP server tailored to your exact needs. Simply provide the documentation in this directory as context to your favorite LLM, describe what you want, and let it create your personalized server.

## How It Works

1. **Provide Context**: Give the LLM the relevant documentation files from this directory
2. **Describe Your Needs**: Tell it what tools, prompts, and resources you want
3. **Generate**: The LLM will create a complete custom MCP server implementation
4. **Deploy**: Save the generated code and start using your custom server

## Essential Documentation to Include as Context

When prompting an LLM, include these key documents:

1. `custom-mcp-server.md` - The comprehensive guide for creating custom servers
2. `creating-tools-multimethod.md` or `creating-tools-without-clojuremcp.md` - Depending on your tool needs
3. `creating-prompts.md` - If you need custom prompts
4. `creating-resources.md` - If you need custom resources

## Example Prompts and Ideas

### 1. Minimal Read-Only Server

```
Using the attached ClojureMCP documentation, create a minimal custom MCP server with:
- Only read-only tools: read_file, glob_files, fs_grep, and directory_tree
- No write capabilities
- A custom prompt that emphasizes code exploration and analysis
- Start on port 3000
```

### 2. Clojure Learning Environment

```
Based on the ClojureMCP documentation provided, generate a custom MCP server for learning Clojure:
- Include only: clojure_eval, read_file, and a custom "explain_code" tool
- Add a learning-focused prompt that encourages step-by-step explanations
- Include all files from "resources/clojure-tutorials/" as resources
- Add a custom resource with common Clojure idioms and patterns
```

### 3. Project Documentation Server

```
Using the ClojureMCP docs, create an MCP server focused on documentation:
- Include tools: read_file, glob_files, fs_grep, and file_write (only for .md files)
- Add a custom tool "generate_docs" that creates documentation from Clojure code
- Include all markdown files from "docs/" directory as resources
- Add a prompt that specializes in technical writing and documentation
- Restrict file operations to only markdown and text files
```

### 4. Code Review Assistant

```
Create a custom ClojureMCP server for code reviews using the attached documentation:
- Tools: read_file, fs_grep, glob_files, code_critique, and a custom "suggest_refactoring" tool
- Add prompts focused on Clojure best practices and code quality
- Include style guides from "resources/style-guides/" as resources
- Create a custom tool that checks for common Clojure anti-patterns
```

### 5. Test-Driven Development Server

```
Generate a ClojureMCP server for TDD workflow based on the provided docs:
- Include: clojure_eval, read_file, file_write, and custom "run_tests" and "generate_test" tools
- Add a TDD-focused prompt that encourages writing tests first
- Create a custom tool that generates test stubs from function definitions
- Include test templates as resources
```

### 6. Data Analysis Server

```
Using ClojureMCP documentation, create a server for data analysis:
- Tools: clojure_eval, read_file, and custom tools for CSV/JSON processing
- Add a custom "visualize_data" tool that generates ASCII charts
- Include data analysis libraries documentation as resources
- Create prompts focused on data exploration and insights
```

### 7. Custom Domain-Specific Server

```
Based on the ClojureMCP docs, create a custom server for [YOUR DOMAIN]:
- Include only tools relevant to [YOUR DOMAIN]
- Add custom tools that wrap [YOUR DOMAIN] operations
- Include all files from "[YOUR DOMAIN]/templates/" as prompts
- Add resources from "[YOUR DOMAIN]/documentation/"
- Create domain-specific prompts that understand [YOUR DOMAIN] terminology
```

## Advanced Customization Examples

### Adding Custom Tools from Existing Code

```
Using ClojureMCP docs, create a server that includes my existing Clojure functions as tools:
- Convert these functions to MCP tools: [paste your functions]
- Use the multimethod approach for complex tools
- Use simple map approach for straightforward tools
- Include appropriate validation and error handling
```

### Integrating External Services

```
Generate a ClojureMCP server that integrates with external services:
- Create a custom tool that calls my REST API at [URL]
- Add a tool that interacts with my database (read-only)
- Include authentication handling
- Add appropriate error handling and retries
```

### Security-Focused Configuration

```
Create a highly restricted ClojureMCP server using the documentation:
- Whitelist only specific directories for file operations
- Disable all write operations except in "/tmp/mcp-workspace/"
- Add custom validation for all user inputs
- Include audit logging for all operations
- Restrict clojure_eval to a safe subset of functions
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: The more detailed your requirements, the better the generated server
2. **Provide Examples**: If you have specific use cases, include them in your prompt
3. **Iterate**: Generate a basic version first, then ask for refinements
4. **Test Incrementally**: Start with a minimal server and add features gradually
5. **Include Constraints**: Specify any security, performance, or compatibility requirements

## Common Patterns to Request

### Tool Selection Patterns
- "Read-only exploration server"
- "Full development environment"
- "Documentation-only server"
- "Testing and validation server"
- "Learning and tutorial server"

### Resource Organization Patterns
- "Include all .md files from directory X as resources"
- "Add all example code from directory Y as prompts"
- "Create a resource hierarchy matching my project structure"

### Custom Tool Ideas
- File format converters (EDN â†” JSON, etc.)
- Project scaffolding tools
- Code generation tools
- Integration with external services
- Domain-specific operations

## Example: Complete Prompt for a Custom Server

```
I need a custom ClojureMCP server for working on my web application. Using the attached
ClojureMCP documentation (custom-mcp-server.md, creating-tools-multimethod.md,
creating-prompts.md, creating-resources.md), please generate a complete custom server with:

TOOLS:
- All read-only tools (read_file, glob_files, fs_grep, directory_tree)
- clojure_eval for REPL interaction
- file_write restricted to only: .clj, .cljs, .edn, .json files
- A custom "validate_api_endpoint" tool that checks if a Ring handler follows our conventions
- A custom "generate_handler" tool that creates boilerplate for new API endpoints

PROMPTS:
- A main prompt that understands our web app architecture (Ring, Reitit, next.jdbc)
- A prompt specifically for API development best practices
- A prompt for database query optimization

RESOURCES:
- Include all files from "doc/api-examples/" as resources
- Add our API conventions guide from "standards/api.md"
- Include common middleware configurations

CONFIGURATION:
- Restrict file operations to our project directory and /tmp
- Start on port 4000
- Include helpful startup message about available tools

Please generate the complete main.clj file with all necessary imports and the server
implementation. Include comments explaining key decisions.
```

## Getting Started

1. Gather the documentation files from this directory
2. Choose your LLM (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
3. Craft your prompt based on the examples above
4. Review and test the generated server
5. Iterate and refine as needed

The possibilities are endless! Your custom MCP server is just a well-crafted prompt away.

## Remember

- The generated server is a starting point - you can always manually refine it
- Test each tool as you add it to ensure it works as expected
- Keep security in mind - restrict file operations appropriately
- Document your custom tools for future reference
- Share interesting configurations with the community!

Happy generating! ðŸš€
